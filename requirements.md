### Project Name - File Sharing Site

### Business Context
Social media is used to share content and support user interaction to build community user bases and provide entertainment

### Problem Statement
Social media is often restricted to sharing certain kinds of media. We want to create a social media platform that is capable of sharing and distributing any kind of file. This way people are able to build a community around other kinds of content, and not be limited by the media sharing limitations of the platform.

### Scope  
The app will be available for mobile and desktop use. 

<ins>In scope:</ins> \
Users will be able to make posts with download links for the media they want to share   
that's compiled into a chronological timeline. Users will also be able to like and dislike posts. The app will support most popular file types

<ins>Potentially in scope:</ins> \
The app will have media player support for posts so users can enjoy content in the app without needing external software. Post tagging that allows for post searches. More options for user interaction like comments and replies. 

<ins>Out of scope:</ins> \
Different pages for types of content and different themes. Multi-user tagging. Private chats. Algorithmic post structuring, like showing what the user would be most interested in. Encryption for private chats or posts.
